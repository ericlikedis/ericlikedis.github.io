## How? 
It was on a Wednesday when I was looking for something to do and decided on giving Four Corners Brewerey a visit. It was here by some random occurance that there was a mixer hosted by the DIFF "Dallas International Film Festival" of course I got to chatting with some folks there and unknowingly began chatting with the CEO of the organization, I became a memeber immediately since I've always enjoied watching films especially those from A24. She then invited me to the exclusive world premiere of The Iron Claw.
