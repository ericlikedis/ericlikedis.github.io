## dell xps machine

today i recieved my dell xps 15 (9500), such a good piece of hardware for development in my opinion

for $350, id say it is a solid machine for what i need it for. (virtual machines, development work, homelabbing, brushing up on enumeration skills after failing the pentest + [here](/_posts/2025-12-05-on-failure.md))

my job is paying for me to take a training from SANS, i've taken one of their certification courses before. however this course is for the certification: [GCTD - GIAC Cloud Threat Detection](https://www.giac.org/certifications/cloud-threat-detection-gctd/) and the training for it is the [SEC 541 - Cloud Threat Detection](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/cloud-security-threat-detection)

this course in particular may require me to use a vm for some of the labs which is why i bought this 5 year old machine and brushing up on some [KQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/kusto/query/?view=microsoft-fabric)

anyways, guess after i pass this pentest + exam in about a week ill be much more relieved to be looking at something that ISN'T pentest + related...lol

ok pushing changes...now
