### it happened

i failed, i failed the `pentest + (PT0-003)` exam. 

not what i wanted to be honest, but like they say. 

_"if you're not failing, you're not learning"_

guess that is all i want to say, im going to take a break and enjoy my PTO this holiday season and hopefully take it again soon before the new year. 

later.
