decided to make some changes to my blog, was having issues with the terminal animation breaking things. 

basically, i removed it. 

now everything works again. also did some maintinence summarized below:

**changed**: mobile css — made the menu touch-friendly (larger tap targets, prevented overflow) and adjusted list layout so date and title stay side-by-side on small screens.

**commented out**: terminal overlay — disabled the fixed terminal/typewriter overlay so it no longer blocks taps.

**updated**: back link behavior and label — back link now points to the archive and displays “back”.

**fixed**: post visibility issue — a post that wasn’t appearing was missing the markdown extension and was corrected so it’s included in the archive.

**inspected**: build workflow and archive logic — verified the deployment workflow does a full build and the archive listing isn’t being artificially limited by the build process.
