decided to make some changes to my blog, was having issues with the terminal animation breaking things. (users cant click into my archive due to the box the terminal was sitting in blocking the link)

basically, i removed it. 

now everything works again. also did some maintinence summarized below:

changed: `main.scss` — added mobile menu fixes (touch-friendly link padding, overflow visible) and later updated mobile post-list styles to use flexbox so the date and title stay side-by-side on small screens.

commented out: `no-style-please.scss` — disabled the .terminal-container / typewriter CSS (fixed bottom overlay) so it no longer blocks taps on mobile.

updated: `back_link.html` — back link now points to archive.html (so the back link goes to the archive list).

updated: `_config.yml` — changed theme_config.back_home_text to back and ensured theme_config.show_description is true; description kept as a folded block with your HTML content.

inspected/found: `post_list.html` & `archive.html` — confirmed archive uses post_list.html without an explicit limit; also discovered a post that didn’t appear was missing the .md extension (you fixed that).

note: earlier attempts to edit .gitignore were tried but not successfully applied, so no lasting changes there.
