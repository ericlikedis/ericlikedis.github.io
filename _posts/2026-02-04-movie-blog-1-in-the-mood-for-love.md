### a movie review
recently i watched [In The Mood For Love](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118694/)

the cinematography is amazing on this film, perfectly captures the mutual longing for something deeper although the premise of their love was under the realization that each of their lovers were having an affair with one another.

in an attempt to understand why their partners would do such a thing, each of them would embark on an intense journey together on their *own* affair.

some of the photos perfectly capture this sense of longing for something more even without a kiss
