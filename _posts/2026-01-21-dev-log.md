## dev log — fixing external links + jekyll build pipeline

i finally got external links behaving correctly across the entire site, including the menu.

### the problem
some links (like spotify) opened in a new tab, while others (instagram, vsco) stubbornly opened in the same tab even though `target="_blank"` existed in the generated html. this turned out to be a mix of theme behavior, build configuration, and plugin wiring issues.

### what i changed

- updated `_includes/menu_item.html` to explicitly inject:
  - `target="_blank"`
  - `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
  for external urls using liquid logic  
- added `jekyll-target-blank` to the `gemfile` so bundler installs the plugin  
- added `jekyll-target-blank` to the `plugins` section in `_config.yml` so jekyll actually loads it  
- fixed the github actions workflow (`jekyll.yml`) to:
  - use ruby 3.1 (compatibility matters)
  - build with `bundle exec jekyll build`
  - rely on bundler caching for consistent dependencies  
  - deploy properly via github pages actions  

### why it works now
everything in the pipeline finally agrees:
- bundler installs the right gems  
- jekyll loads the plugin  
- liquid renders the correct attributes at template time  
- github actions builds the site using the same rules as local  

instead of relying on hacks or fragile post-processing, the behavior is now enforced at the source.
