#### hurry up tomorrow

the weight of yesterday still lingers, but for the first time in years, it doesn’t press so heavily on my chest. i have spent too long drowning in regret, chasing fleeting highs that only left me emptier. the ghosts of my past may never fully fade, but i no longer let them dictate my future. there was a time when i thought i was beyond saving—too broken, too lost, too far gone to ever climb out of the abyss i had created. but i was wrong.

tomorrow comes whether i’m ready or not, and i’ve decided to meet it on my own terms.

the echoes of **REDACTED** voice still creep in during the quiet moments, whispering words i once let define me. liar. disgrace. but i no longer shrink from them. i no longer let them shape who i am. they are remnants of a life i no longer belong to, scars that remind me of the road i traveled but do not control where i go next.

i am not the man who wandered the streets, looking for an escape at the bottom of a bottle. i am not the man who let love slip through his fingers, too afraid to hold on, too desperate to run. i am not the man who let his demons win, who let his past dictate his present.

i am still healing. some days, the weight of it all is unbearable, and the darkness threatens to pull me under again. but i fight. i choose to fight. not just for myself, but for the people i hurt, the ones i pushed away when i was too lost to see clearly. i make amends where i can. i take accountability. i face the pain instead of numbing it. it is the hardest thing i have ever done, but it is also the most important.

the past cannot be rewritten, but the future is mine to shape. i will never be the boy i was before the world hardened me, before the losses and the heartbreaks and the self-inflicted wounds. but i can be something better. someone who acknowledges his mistakes but does not let them define him. someone who loves fully and honestly. someone who no longer runs from himself.

i don’t know what tomorrow holds. maybe peace, maybe struggle. but i will meet it head-on.

for the first time in a long time, i am not looking back. i am moving forward.

_hurry up, tomorrow_.
